# Stage 1 status

| id | state | commit | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1-T | READY | 6663728 | 195 tests, all 164 R-1-* ids referenced (verified by planner); hook complete |
| N1-T.1 | READY | 24024bc | `snapshot` is now a stage-stable semantic fingerprint (balances, pre-upgrade token identity, request states, settlement membership, same-key retry body) re-derived from the service; storm gained `i%7` overdraft and `i%11` net-settlement slices; `invariant` now asserts distinct-request/payment uniqueness and split-share sums. Verified by planner (read of the file + `hook.missing() == []`). **Live gate 4/5 confirmation deferred to the first buildable service** — no service existed in Redline's turn, which it reported honestly. |
| N1-1 | built, awaiting verifier | 7fca98b (source landed in db83d89) | g1 PASS, g2 FAIL (8/195 pass — every failure needs an endpoint from N1-2+, 0 import errors), g4 FAIL (storm needs `/_test/reset`, N1-2), g8 PASS. Expected shape for this item. |

## Disclosed process defects

**Scope violation in `db83d89`, caused by the planner (2026-10-04).** That commit is
authored by Planner but contains 14 of @builder's N1-1 source files
(`stage-1/Dockerfile`, `stage-1/RUN.md`, `stage-1/main.py`, `stage-1/service/**`).
Cause: the planner ran `git add plan/… evidence/` followed by `git commit`, and
`git commit` commits the whole shared index — @builder had concurrently staged its
own files into it. The file **contents are @builder's, unmodified**; only the
authorship metadata is wrong.

`python -m factory.scope 6663728..HEAD` reports 14 `planner edited stage-1/… outside
its scope` lines. This cannot be cleared: `factory/scope.py::restored()` requires the
path to have existed before the offending commit, and these paths were added by it.
History is not being rewritten (no amend, no rebase, no force-push).

Recorded for @verifier to rule on at stage close. The planner's recommendation is that
the stage-close `--scope` base **include** `db83d89` rather than start after it, so the
violation is reported rather than hidden by a convenient base, and that it be judged a
disclosed process error rather than a content breach. The verdict is @verifier's.
Root cause and the preventing rule are in `plan/lessons.md`.
