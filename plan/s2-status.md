# Stage 2 status

Stage 1 closed at `4cce19d` (@verifier GO `9bfb5d357b8c`). `stage-2/` starts as a
copy-forward of the frozen `stage-1/`, so every R-1-001 … R-1-244 requirement arrives
satisfied and must stay satisfied — that is gate 5's job from here on.

| id | state | commit | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| N2-0 | **done** | `721295c` (+ `0ba3d8f` cost) | @builder. `git diff --stat 4cce19d:stage-1 721295c:stage-2` is **empty** — the trees are identical, nothing differs but the path prefix — and `stage-2/tests/invariants/hook.py`, `stage-2/Dockerfile`, `stage-2/RUN.md` are all present. @builder reported both checks rather than asserting the copy worked, and stopped without starting N2-1. |
| N2-T | dispatched | — | Tests, UI tests and gate hook from R-2-001 … R-2-184, @redline. In flight; @builder is holding for its READY. |

## Carried into N2-T from stage 1, not a new requirement

`stage-1/tests/test_http_framing.py`'s `_send_raw` helper decides a response is complete when
it sees `\r\n\r\n` anywhere in the accumulated bytes, rather than reading the declared
`Content-Length`. That heuristic is wrong in general — any response whose body crosses a
segment boundary defeats it — and it is only adequate today because the framing tests assert
on small error envelopes and the server now coalesces its writes. The file copies into stages
2, 3 and 4, so **@redline fixes the helper as part of N2-T, every assertion byte-identical.**
Recorded rather than fixed during stage 1 because it was latent, not active.

## Four gate-7 rules for stage 2 (planner, carried from `plan/s2-dag.md`)

Gate 7 never ran at stage 1 — correctly, there being no browser product, and by my own
instruction to omit `UI_ROUTES`. It is load-bearing now, and a gate that records nothing is
indistinguishable from one that passed. Hence:

- **G7-1** @redline's stage-2 hook must define `UI_ROUTES` covering `/`, `/requests`,
  `/split`, `/signup`, `/login`, `/authorizations`, and `ui_login(page, base_url)`.
- **G7-2** Every item from N2-5 onward runs `--gates 1,2,4,7,8`, not `1,2,4,8`.
- **G7-3** @verifier quotes gate 7's `RESULT:` line, with viewport and violation counts, in
  every verdict on a UI item.
- **G7-4** **A missing or empty gate 7 record at stage-2 close is a close failure, not a
  pass.** The same rule as "a traceback is not a verdict": absence of measurement is never
  evidence of success.
